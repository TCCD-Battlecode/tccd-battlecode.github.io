## What is Battlecode?

Built by students at MIT, Battlecode is a real-time strategy game in which you will write code for an autonomous player. The code you write will power this player to manage a robot army and become the general that provides direction for your robots to defeat the enemy team. By joining the competition, you will get to learn aspects of programming, such as artificial intelligence, pathfinding, distributed algorithms, and communications while working with your team to be as competitive as possible!

## FAQ

### What Languages are supported?

While the Battlecode engine is built using Java, contestants will be using the experimental Python version of the game that released last year.

### AI, as in Machine Learning?

The Battlecode competition uses the term AI in the more traditional, game design sense, in that you are writing the Pathfinding, Resource Management, Communication, and Combat Tactics logic both on a local scale (determing which robot to attack first) and global scale (which units to send where and when), similar to how NPCs (Non-Player Characters) work in video games.
