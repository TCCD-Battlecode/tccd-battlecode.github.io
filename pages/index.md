## Welcome to the Battle

Welcome to TCC NW's first annual Battlecode competition!

Battlecode is an exciting competition that pits teams of 1-4 students against each other, creating armies of robots and managing resources.

We will be holding information sessions for starting Battlecode running from September 29th to October 2nd, from 12pm-4pm in NW04 1123, but you can [sign up now!](/registration/). Once you're registered and have a team, you can [register your team](/registration/teams/). From there, follow our [Quick Start Guide](/quick_start/) to get started!

The tournament itself will be held later this semester. We will also be having weekly practice/coding sessions, and you can find more details on the [sessions page](/sessions/).

### GOOD LUCK!
