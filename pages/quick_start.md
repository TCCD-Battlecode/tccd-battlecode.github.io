## Overview

This is the TCCD Battlecode 2025 information site, which will be you main hub for all Battlecode-related things.

_The bread and food of yore has begun to run out, forcing robot society to adapt. Gone are the jovial ducks, replaced by steampunk robot bunnies who have converted their need for nutrients into a reliance on paint. These bunnies have become territorial, forming clans and defense formations to protect the resources that keep them running._

_For the past two centuries, these bunnies have stayed within their own territory, but clans have begun to degrade their environment and need to start branching out. Will these clans be able to expand their territory and generate enough paint to protect their families? Or will they stray too close to other clans and be wiped out in the conflict?_

## Team Creation

In order to participate, you will need to have a GitHub.com account, and a team. Each team can consist of 1 to 4 people. When you form your team, you need to come up with a **school appropriate** team name to compete under.

## Installation and Setup

You can set up the Battlecode tools and engine on your personal computer, or you can use a Codespace that has been set up for the Battlecode Participant repository.

### Getting Started

Once your team has been created on GitHub, you can go to your team organization page and create your codespace following these steps:

1. From your team organization page, click on the **Repositories** tab.
2. Click on the code repo. It should be the only repo on there, but if not, it will be the one named `Battlecode-<TeamName>`.
3. Click on the green **Code** button
4. Click on the **Codespaces** tab, then on the **Create codespace on main** button. It will open a new window and work on creating the codespace. This will take several minutes the first time you run it, but will open much quicker every other time you open the same codespace.
5. Once the codespace has opened, you will need to set up your environment for working with Battlecode by running the install process by typing `python ./run.py update` into the terminal. This will download the current engine and client. You can open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + \`.

You now have your codespace ready! You can view an example bot code by looking in the `examplefuncsplayer` folder. I recommend creating a new folder and copying the example bot into the new folder to create your own code, this way you can refer back to the example as you work.

Working in your teams on this code will require you to become familiar with Git and GitHub. Each Codespace is a virtual computer and every member on the team will have their own Codespace. For your team members to view the code, you will need to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your code to GitHub, and then `pull` down updates. You can refer to the [Battlecode Player's GitHub Guide](/github/) for more information.
