## Overview

This is the TCCD Battlecode 2025 information site, which will be you main hub for all Battlecode-related things.

_The bread and food of yore has begun to run out, forcing robot society to adapt. Gone are the jovial ducks, replaced by steampunk robot bunnies who have converted their need for nutrients into a reliance on paint. These bunnies have become territorial, forming clans and defense formations to protect the resources that keep them running._

_For the past two centuries, these bunnies have stayed within their own territory, but clans have begun to degrade their environment and need to start branching out. Will these clans be able to expand their territory and generate enough paint to protect their families? Or will they stray too close to other clans and be wiped out in the conflict?_
