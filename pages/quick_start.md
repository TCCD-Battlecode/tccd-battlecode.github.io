## Overview

This is the TCCD Battlecode 2025 information site, which will be you main hub for all Battlecode-related things.

_The bread and food of yore has begun to run out, forcing robot society to adapt. Gone are the jovial ducks, replaced by steampunk robot bunnies who have converted their need for nutrients into a reliance on paint. These bunnies have become territorial, forming clans and defense formations to protect the resources that keep them running._

_For the past two centuries, these bunnies have stayed within their own territory, but clans have begun to degrade their environment and need to start branching out. Will these clans be able to expand their territory and generate enough paint to protect their families? Or will they stray too close to other clans and be wiped out in the conflict?_

## Team Creation

In order to participate, you will need to have a GitHub.com account, and a team. Each team can consist of 1 to 4 people. When you form your team, you need to come up with a **school appropriate** team name to compete under.

## Installation and Setup

You can set up the Battlecode tools and engine on your personal computer, or you can use a Codespace that has been set up for the Battlecode Participant repository.

### Getting Started

Before anything else, you'll need to have one member of the team create your team GitHub repo by going to the Battlecode Scaffold and clicking on "Use this template." Make sure you set the new repo to Private (you don't want other teams to view your code) when creating the repository. Use your team name as the repo name.
