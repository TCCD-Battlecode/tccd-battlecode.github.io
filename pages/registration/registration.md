# Registration

To participate in the Battlecode tournament, you will need to first register as a participant, then register with your team. Teams can be made up of 1-4 players, you just need to know who will be in your team and come up with a school appropriate team name to get signed up!

## Individual Registration

If you haven't already, create a GitHub account first by going to the [GitHub sign-up page](https://github.com/signup). You can use any email and username for this account, but we recommend a professional sounding username as it is difficult to change this later.

## Team Registration

Once you have completed the individual registration and gathered your team, you can fill out the form here to register your team into the tournament. You'll need your **school appropriate** team name and the names of each of your members (the names they registered with). We will then set up your Team in our GitHub Battlecode organization with your Battlecode repository so you can begin working on your bots!
