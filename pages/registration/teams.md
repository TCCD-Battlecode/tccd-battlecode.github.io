# Signing Up Your Team

Once you have completed the [individual registration](/registration/) and gathered your team, you can fill out the form here to register your team into the tournament. You'll need your **school appropriate** team name and the names of each of your members (the names they registered with). We will then set up your Team in our GitHub Battlecode organization with your Battlecode repository so you can begin working on your bots!
